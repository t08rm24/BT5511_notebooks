Our goal is to introduce the Python programming language and the principles behind computer programming in a way that will allow you to continue using this new skill, or develop it further if you so wish.\n",

This is an _ideal_ way to learn progrmaming as it will allow you to play around and test out bits of Python code to understand how they work. They are commonly used in data science as they allow the quick execution of code for analysis. We will use Jupyter notebooks for all practical sessions, and I recommend using them for your assignment too. If you have done a lot of programming previously then you may use your favourite IDE or text editor, but for trouble-shooting and assignments please use the jupyter notebook.\n"

    "**NB: Use with caution** While loops can be tricky to work with and debug, as they can result in an infinite loop, i.e. one that never ends because the event to break the loop doesn't ever happen in the code. This will manifest as the code hanging, i.e. taking a long time to finish (an infinite amount of time infact)."
